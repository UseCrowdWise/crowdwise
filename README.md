# Webpage Discussions: Browser Extensions

This project explores how we can embed existing (and related?) discussions into the webpage that a user is viewing.

For instance, if a user browses abc.xyz/article-name, they might see related discussions from Hacker News, Reddit, Product Hunt, etc.

## Possible features

- Search through all comments and show the user the most discussed / highly rated ones
- List all outbound links in HN/Reddit/etc comments (+ some context, the comment/thread?) so user can find relevant followup material
- Rank comments by relevancy (vs random off-topic comments)
- Show comments on top of the article in the right places (very difficult, need to know how to link text content in article to comments)
