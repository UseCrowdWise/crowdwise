# What's CrowdWise?

CrowdWise is a Google Chrome extension that adds to your browsing experience by showing you relevant discussions about your current web page from Hacker News and Reddit.

## Features

### Discussions on Hacker News and Reddit

- When you navigate to a web page, CrowdWise pulls relevant discussions about this web page from Hacker News and Reddit. You can click on these discussions and it will - open in a new tab, where you can find counter-opinions and different perspectives.

### Incognito Mode

By default, CrowdWise searches for relevant discussions in the background. For additional privacy, CrowdWise also includes an Incognito mode where it will only search for discussions when you click on the CrowdWise button.

### Personalised Settings

Adjust the sidebar to suit the look and feel that you like. You can customise the following:

- Keyboard shortcuts to open and close the sidebar
- Font sizes
- Sidebar width
- and more

### Open Source and Extensible

Our source code is available on GitHub on a MIT license, allowing you to easily extend CrowdWise the way you want and be part of our community!
